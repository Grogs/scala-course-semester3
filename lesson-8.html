WebSockets and Actors
~
What are websockets?

Note: Who's heard of web sockets?
~
Two-way communication between browser and server

Note: 
* As opposed to the typical request/response model.
* Traditionally you request a page, get a response, render, and you're done.
* With websockets, you open a conneciton and keep it open as long as you like - normally as long as the page is open.
* This is quite common - Facebook chat is a typical example.
~~~~
Push vs Pull
~
Historically we had AJAX polling to show live changes on a page

Client just keeps "polling" the server to see if there are updates <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
~
Then came along "long polling"

![Long Polling diagram](longpolling.jpg)  

Client makes request to server.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Server holds the connection open until there is an event to "push" to the client.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Then the client sends the next long-living request  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
* Are there any potential problems you can see with this?
~
Then came along WebSockets and Server Sent Events
~
**Server sent events (SSE)** let you push events from the server single long-lived connection.  
  
<br />
**WebSockets** give you a *bidirectional* long-lived connection

Note: 
* SSE is more efficient than long-polling
~
**WebSockets** mimics HTTP to start a connection, then switches to lower level Data Frames.  

Good browser support, but proxies can have issues. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
~
**Server Sent Events** use HTTP so avoid any issues with proxies.  

But they have less browser support and are limited to one-way server-to-client communication. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: IE/Edge still doesn't have support.
~
Play has great support for WebSockets  

Each WebSocket connection is modelled as an Akka Actor

~~~~
The Actor Model
~
A way to model concurrent computation.  

Sometimes refered to as *"light-weight threads"*
~ 
An actor consists of a mailbox of messages and a receive method.

![Simple Actor](actor.png)
~
The `receive` method processes one message at a time from the mailbox.
~
Actors are often stateful.

![Actors have state](actorstate.png)

Messages are processed sequentially - so no race conditions. 
~

Simple example 

```scala
class PongActor extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case "ping" => sender() ! "pong"
  }
}
```

Notes:
* Mailbox is hidden
* Received methods will only be called once at a time.
	* So you could safely record keep state in here (e.g. the count of pings)
* In this example `receive` is a partial function, so it would fail on any input other than "ping"
	* Actors have an idea of supervision, which will handle such scenarios. I won't go into that now unless anyone is interested.
* sender() is a special method which lets you get a reference to the Actor that sent the current message.
~
Actors communicate by sending messages.  

![Actors send messages](actormessaging.png)

Note:This is closer to how Alan Kay initially conceived Object Oriented Programming in Smalltalk.  
~
By keeping messages immutable, we don't have to worry about concurrency issues.

Note: 
* If message is immutable, you can pass it around and they cannot modify it.  
* Erlang (and Elixir) actually make use of the fact that messages are sent instead of memory being shared. It allows them to independentally GC actors and avoid long pauses.
~
You can model your whole system using Actors by composing them to form Actor Systems.  

![Actor System](actorsystem.png)
~ 
Akka is the dominant Actor implementation for Scala &amp; Java

Note:
Java is absolutely a first class citizen. 
~
Play is implemented on top of Akka HTTP.

Akka HTTP is implemented with Akka Actors.

Note: 
* We use Akka Actors in my team. We're actually in the process of removing them. 
* They're a low level abstraction, which makes them hard to reason about.
~~~~
### WebSockets and Actors in Play 
~
In Play, we model each side of a WebSocket connection as an actor.   
~
A pair of actors is created for every websocket connection.  

<img class="plain"  src="PlayActors.png"/>

Note:
* So if there were three simultantious users connected with websockets, we would have 6 Actors.
* Actors are a cheap abstraction, so we can have many at once.
~
The client and server can both independentally send messages to each other.

Note: So you can use WebSockets for one way streaming, like SSE, or request/response, or whatever you want.
~

Now let's see some code
